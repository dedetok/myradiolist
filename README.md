Hello
i'm sorry for slow update, I'm doing this in my idle time

myradio_radiolist.csv contains list of radio country, city, radio name, url logo and url stream
myradiolistversion.txt contains version when myradio_radiolist.csv created and check agains url in the list

Note: 
1. some of url may change due depend on radio provider
2. some of the radio station may be redistributed, you need to recheck it

if you have request for a new radio station, or reporting broken link radio station, put it in issuea. we are trying to solved it, and once more, we are sorry for slow response. 

The application use this can be found at google playstore https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dedetok.radiowalkman&pcampaignid=web_share

Thank you.

We are trying to find out the broken link and update it.
